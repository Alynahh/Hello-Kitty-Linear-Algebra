# Hello Kitty Matrix Transformations 

A Linear Algebra project

## Group Task
Apply the following transformations to a cartoon plotted using Python:
-  Compression along the y-axis by a factor of 1/3
-  Shear along the x-axis by a factor of 4

##  Cartoon Details
We recreated Hello Kitty using coordinate-based drawing (no image uploads), plotted on a coordinate system using `matplotlib`.

##  Files
- `hello_kitty_group6_final.py`: Full source code with transformations
- `hello_kitty_group6_output.pdf`: Output showing original and transformed Hello Kitty on coordinate plane
- `README.md`: You're reading it!

##  How to Run
```bash
pip install matplotlib numpy
python hello_kitty_group6_final.py
